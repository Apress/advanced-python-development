Generic single-database configuration.


# Database setup

To generate the required database tables you must create an alembic.ini file, as follows:

    [alembic]
    script_location = apd.aggregation:alembic
    sqlalchemy.url = postgresql+psycopg2://apd@localhost/apd

and run `alembic upgrade head`. This should also be done after every upgrade of the software.
